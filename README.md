2. Protect routes: `/client/*`, `/cleaner/*`, `/admin/*`
3. Add "My Account" pages

### Phase 4: Notifications (Week 2)

2. Test email sending via `lib/notifications.ts`
3. Set up Quo API for SMS
4. Test SMS sending
5. Add notification preferences (client/cleaner settings)

### Phase 5: Photo Uploads & Job Completion (Week 3)
1. Add file upload to S3 or Cloudinary
2. Build before/after photo capture in cleaner app
3. Implement `/cleaner/job/[id]/complete` page
4. Wire up job completion workflow (triggers payment hold check)

### Phase 6: Payments & Payouts (Week 3)

## How This Stays Hands-Off

- **For clients:** They self-serve (quote → book → pay). Zero manual work.
- **For cleaners:** Auto-assigned from availability. System sends notifications.
- **For you:** 
  - Approve new cleaners 1x (background check auto-triggered)
  - Resolve disputes only (payment holds, ratings disputes)
  - Monitor dashboard weekly (optional)
  - All payments/payouts run on schedule automatically

## Key Files to Watch
